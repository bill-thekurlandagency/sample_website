    <h1>About us</h1>
    <p>
      <em>The Kurland Agency was founded by Ted Kurland in 1975 in Boston.</em>
      At the time, he was a recent graduate from Brandeis University with a major in
      Economics. After Kurland graduated, he first worked for a small Boston
      talent agency, an invaluable experience that launched his career into the
      talent booking business. With two partners, he later started All American
      Talent, an agency that booked primarily blues artists such as Muddy
      Waters, Howlin’ Wolf, Willie Dixon, George Thorgood, Ko Ko Taylor, among
      others. <strong>All American Talent turned into Ted Kurland Associates (now The
      Kurland Agency) and the agency’s emphasis shifted to booking jazz
      performers.</strong>

    <h3>Cameron Graves</h3>

    <p>The release of Kamasi Washington’s The Epic last year marked a seismic
      shift in the jazz landscape and the game-changing arrival of the
      genre-blurring Los Angeles collective West Coast Get Down. That evolution
      continues with the release of Planetary Prince, the debut album by
      visionary pianist, keyboardist, composer and WCGD founding member
      CAMERON GRAVES.
